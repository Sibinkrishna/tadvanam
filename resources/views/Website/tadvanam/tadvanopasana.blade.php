                                        Tadvanam, the unique Vedic Brahmopasana, is from Kenopanishad of the Samaveda. The four Vedas extol the supreme state of 'Amritanandam', or immortal bliss, with revered language, and provide guidance on attaining this state through various spiritual practices
                                        and forms of worship known as 'Upasanas'.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".3s" style="text-align: justify;">The Vedas embody the highest ideals and most sublime aspects of human civilization. ‘Among the Vedas, I am the Samaveda’ is what the Bhagawan proclaims in the Gita. The Kenopanishad originates in the Talavakara Brahmana
                                        of the Samaveda. The word 'Tadvanam', synonymous with 'Brahman', along with its ‘Upasana’, or spiritual practices, are elucidated in the fourth chapter of this Upanishad.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".2s" style="text-align: justify;">Every form of worship has its unique characteristics, rooted in the fundamental triad (‘Triputi’) of worshiper, worship, and the object of worship. However, this raises a profound question: how can one worship Brahman,
                                        which is the ultimate reality underlying all existence, omnipresent, imperishable, and the essence of everything?

                                        Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi, revered by Sri Ranganathananda Swamiji as the 'Shree Suka of the modern age', offers profound insights into this query. In his own work, 'Saddarshanam', the first shloka presents the following wisdom:
                                    </p>

                                                of Existence? The
                                                Pure Reality can be located at the seat of consciousness (known as the

                            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".2s" style="text-align: justify;">
                                This affirmation underscores that remembering or meditating on Sat (existence) or the true self essentially means 'abiding as that'. Hence, being one with Brahman itself is the worship of Brahman.</p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".2s" style="text-align: justify;">
                                This is further affirmed in Sri Bhagavan's other work, ‘Upadesa Saram’, which says "Atmanirdvyaad Atmanishtata" Self-abidance is to realise non-duality of the self.
                            </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".2s" style="text-align: justify;">
                                In essence, Worship of Brahman is to be Brahman. When the inner realm, influenced by sensory temptations, becomes outward, and one controls through various methods and practice the self-abidance it is a practice and when that self-abidance becomes natural
                                state of one, it is called self-realisation. Even though the great souls, whose inner realms are pure would realise this on the first advise itself, the majority, being Mandadhikari (slow learners), benefit from the compassionate
                                Jnanaswaroopas (embodiments of knowledge) who establish various methods of worship.</p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".2s" style="text-align: justify;">
                                The foundation of all worship is the worshiper, and the qualifications of the worshiper determine the fruit of the worship. Therefore, any worship includes instructions to develop the worshiper's qualifications, primarily focusing on sense control. As
                                per the god incarnate Bhagawan Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, "renounce lust and greed." The level of sense control determines the rapid attainment of the worship’s fruit. Brahman worship is distinct from other Saguna (qualified)
                                worships, as its path and destination are the same, and requires the worshiper to be highly qualified and controlled. There is a saying that ‘The Self that is going outwards is called mind and the mind going inwards is
                                called Atman".
                            </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".2s" style="text-align: justify;">
                                Countless traditional methods of worship guide the path across Bharat (India). The Tadvanam meditation from the Kenopanishad is one such ancient method, with Sri Bhagavati as the guru imparting knowledge to Indra, the king of gods. While in other Upasanas
                                Rishis advise to mortal humans, here it is different. The speciality repeats in the advice too. It is to worship the Brahman which is the cause and effect of everything with a special name "Tadvanam".
                            </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".2s" style="text-align: justify;">
                                Various names, including Omkara, have been used for Brahman in the Vedas and they have been elaborated in Vedas, Upanishads and various other scriptures. But the word "Tadvanam", though the Vedas prescribed this worshipping of Brahman in name and quality
                                and the same was specifically mentioned in the Shankara Bhashya (commentary), lacks additional details in Vedic literature available till date. However, the divine promise that those who worship Brahman as "Tadvanam" will
                                be adored and loved by all just like Brahman, serves as a unique reward, indicating the specific nature of this Vedic meditation.
                            </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".2s" style="text-align: justify;">
                                This can be seen as an indication towards highly secret, deep and supernatural practice. Vedas often use this cryptic language so the seeker can interpret based on his mental ability.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".2s" style="text-align: justify;">
                                In the spiritual sciences the age of a philosophy or practice adds to its weightage. From this angle, majority of the Vedantists depend on the commentaries of Sri Sankaracharya. Bhagawan Sankara, has written two commentaries for Kena Upanishad thus inviting
                                our attention to this Upanishad specifically out of the ten for which he wrote commentary.All of this makes it clear that this ancient Vedic practice is of utmost significance.
                            </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".2s" style="text-align: justify;">
                                After listening to the advice to worship Brahman as Tadvanam in name and quality, the disciple becomes curious to know the ways to achieve this realisation, and there the Upanishad talks about the practical methods of this worship.
                            </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".2s" style="text-align: justify;">
                                Tapas (austerity), Dama (self-control), Karma (righteous actions) and truthfulness are the means to achieve purity of mind (Sattva-shuddhi), and this knowledge is well-established in the Vedas and Vedangas. The Upanishads eloquently state that complete
                                adherence to truth (Satyanishta) is the seat of this purity.
                            </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".2s" style="text-align: justify;">
                                Self-realization is not something that can be achieved through Karma (actions) or other means alone. So why prescribe such practices for attaining Brahman? If being questioned like this we have to point towards an analogy from Vedas, 'How can pure cow’s
                                milk be stored in a container made from a dog's skin?' This analogy from the Shruti emphasizes the necessity of Sattva-shuddhi (purity of mind). Without achieving self-realization at the first hearing, the need for mental
                                purity becomes evident. Therefore, these prescriptions are not for attainment of Brahman but for mental purity. Without adhering to such practices, mere hearing or contemplation of the principles will never make us capable
                                of experiencing the true self. Just as meditation cannot be perfected without the foundational practices of Yama and Niyama, only with the combination of Tapas (austerity), Dama (self-control), Karma (righteous actions),
                                truthfulness, and the study of Vedic scriptures, can the Tadvanam meditation be complete.
                            </p>
                            <p class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".2s" style="text-align: justify;">
                                In this modern age, despite the myriad challenges and unnecessary material accumulations, humans still have plenty of time to reflect on their lives. During such intervals, while calmly considering what has been gained, what is still sought, and what
                                has been lost, one should also ponder over the fundamental question: Who am I, the one at the center of all these experiences? This is the purpose of such distinguished scriptures and profound methods of meditation.The
                                lineage of far-sighted sages has deeply thought about, observed, experimented with, and understood all aspects of life, and they impart this knowledge to us. Without knowing the knower and the experiencer, tirelessly running
                                day and night to know and experience is futile. Therefore, one should first strive to know oneself. This is where the Kenopanishad begins.What is it that gives the mind, senses, speech, and life their respective abilities
                                to grasp their objects? Without knowing this, living with the egoistic pride of 'I' is meaningless, even like the lives of gods. Therefore, with the grace of our guru lineage, may we attain the realization to worship that
                                Brahman known as 'Tadvanam' through the method of name and quality, with this prayer.
