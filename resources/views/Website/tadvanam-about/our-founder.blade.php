                            <p class="text-wrap" style="text-align: justify;">Sri Jayakumar Ramakrishnan, lovingly referred to as Jayettan by many, and affectionately addressed as Swami Jayaramakrishna by some revered Swamis, is the visionary founder of Tadvanam Ashramam. Sri Jayettan was born in 1976
                                in the Palakkad District of Kerala. His mother, Smt. Hemalatha Viswanathan, was an ardent devotee of Bhagawan Shiva, and hisfather, Sri. V. C. Ramakrishnan, was a public worker who dedicated his life to serving the community
                                in his entire life.</p>

            </section>
            <section style="position: relative; background-color: #f1ffdd !important;padding-top: 0 ;">
                <div class="container">
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 mt-3">
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Sri Jayettan began his public service at a very young age. At just 15 years old, he started taking classes for elderly citizens through the Literacy Mission of Kerala. At the age of 17, he began his spiritual odyssey under
                                the mentorship of Sriman A.B. Shanmukhanji of Vijnana Ramaneeya Ashrama, fondly called as Sri Shanmughettan. Although Jayettan humbly refrains from speaking extensively about his association with Sriman A.B. Shanmukhanji,
                                it is clear that this revered relationship served as the cornerstone of his profound spiritual growth and development.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;"> Despite facing numerous challenges, including poverty, in his young age, Jayettan persevered in his spiritual pursuit and public service. There were times when he had to take on daily labour to repay family debts. However,
                                he remained committed to his spiritual journey and continued to work tirelessly for the betterment of society. At that juncture, Sri Jayakumar Ramakrishnan was inclined to embrace Sannyasam, but a pivotal letter from a
                                revered Swami altered the course of his life. The Swami's counsel was profound: "Wait until you attain a state where you perceive no distinction between the ascetic and materialistic paths."</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Sri Jayettan's leadership skills and dedication to public service led to him becoming the president of Bala Bhawan, a child welfare organization under the control of the Orphanage Control Board, Kerala at the age of 25. During
                                his tenure, he became a source of comfort and support for many destitute children. </p>
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">At the age of 28, Jayettan founded Vivekananda Darshanika Samajam, an organization aimed For over 15 years, he worked relentlessly for the organization, conducting youth-oriented and public relief activities across India and
                                beyond. Notably, he managed to balance his government service with his work for Vivekananda Darshanika Samajam, demonstrating his exceptional dedication and time management skills. Moreover, Sri Jayettan embodied the spirit
                                of Swami Vivekananda's teachings, which emphasize selfless service without seeking name or fame. True to this ideal, Jayettan always kept away from the limelight during programs, instead providing opportunities for the
                                younger generation to take center stage, thereby nurturing their growth and development</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout his spiritual journey, Jayettan has been guided and advised by several great spiritual masters, including Mata Amritanandamayi Devi, Swami Mridanandaji Maharaj of Ramakrishna Math, Sri Sri Maharaj ji of Haridwar,
                                Swami Srividyanandaji Maharaj of Tiruvannamalai and Swami Saradanandaji Maharaj of Varanasi. These interactions have significantly contributed to his spiritual growth and development. </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-12 mt-3">
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">In 2020, Swami Jayaramakrishna renounced his career in the Department of Civil Judiciary, Government of Kerala, to pursue a life of asceticism. During a visit to Tiruvannamalai in the meantime, Sri Jayakumar Ramakrishnan had
                                the privilege of meeting great Swamiji, a revered monk formerly associated with Belur Math as training head. It was him who graciously bestowed upon him the monastic name 'Swami Jayaramakrishna'.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">This marked the beginning of a new chapter in his life, as he established Tadvanam Ashramam.
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">The establishment of Tadvanam Ashramam and his transition into ascetic life marked the culmination of a lifelong spiritual inquiry that began in his childhood. From a young age, he had harboured an intense desire to embark
                                on the path of Sannyasin, but he chose not to pursue this calling against his parents' wishes.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Following his father's passing, on the auspicious occasion of Kartika Deepam in 2020, Sri Jayettan had a transformative experience at Tiruvannamalai. On this sacred day, he witnessed a Virajahomam, a revered ritual often performed
                                by individuals on the cusp of embracing Sannyasa life, marking a profound turning point in his own spiritual journey.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">After this, Jayettan sought his mother's permission to enter ascetic life. This time, she gave her blessings, and he embarked on his ascetic journey, ultimately leading to the establishment of Tadvanam Ashramam. Nestled in
                                a secluded clearing, surrounded by dense forest, the Ashram lies in a pristine wilderness, untouched by human habitation for a radius of 6 km. This tranquil retreat is home to an array of wildlife, where nature's beauty
                                and serenity prevail.
                            </p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Since its inception, Tadvanam Ashramam has become an extension of Vivekananda Darshanika Samajam, serving as its principal center.</p>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Currently, Swami Jayaramakrishna resides at Tadvanam Ashramam, situated atop the picturesque Kalladikode hills in the Western Ghats of Palakkad district, Kerala.</p>
